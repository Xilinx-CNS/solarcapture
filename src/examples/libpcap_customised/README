Introduction
============

 This sample shows how to customise the SolarCapture libpcap bindings.

 Normally the SolarCapture libpcap bindings behave in the standard way;
 capturing packets from a network interface and passing them to the client
 application.  But it is also possible to configure libpcap to source
 packets from a custom SolarCapture node.

 This is achieved by setting an interface name that starts with "sc:".  The
 remainder of the interface name gives a node specification, as defined by
 the sc_node_alloc_from_str() API call.  Here is an example:

   sc:sc_vi_node:interface=eth4

 In this case the libpcap bindings would instatiate an sc_vi_node and pass
 it the argument "interface=eth4".

 The sample code in this directory illustrates this feature and solves the
 following problem: Provide a libpcap application with a sampled subset of
 the packets arriving at a network interface.

 Libpcap is configured to create a custom node called "sampled" which
 supplies a random sampling of packets.  The "sampled" node achieves this
 by creating an sc_vi_node to capture packets, and an sc_filter node to
 sample them.  The output of the sc_filter node becomes the input to the
 libpcap application.

 This sample consists of the following parts:

   sampled.c - A custom SolarCapture node which captures packets from a
               network interface and forwards a sampled subset of the
               captured packets to its output.

   solar_libpcap_sampled
             - A script that can be used to invoke an application that uses
               libpcap.  It sets up the environment so that the "sampled"
               node is used to supply packets to the libpcap bindings.


Compiling
=========

 On a host that has SolarCapture SDK installed, run make:

   $ make


Using
=====

 The following command line causes tcpdump to see a random sampling of 1%
 of the packets received on interface "eth4":

   $ ./solar_libpcap_sampled eth4 .01 tcpdump -i eth4
