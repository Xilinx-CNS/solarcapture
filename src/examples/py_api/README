Introduction
============

 This example illustrates basic use of the SolarCapture python bindings.
 The python bindings can be used to embed SolarCapture into a python
 application.  The python bindings are used to setup and control a packet
 processing pipeline.

 Note that custom packet processing nodes can only be written in C (not
 python), but they can then be incorporated into a SolarCapture session
 using the python bindings.

 You will find further examples using the python bindings, such as in the
 examples/forwarding subdirectory.

 The example itself is an extremely simple topology, consisting of just
 a VI to capture packets and a writer node to output captured packets
 to a pcap file.


Command line usage
==================

 The example can be invoked from the command line.  As it captures all
 traffic on an interface it will require root privileges.  Both the
 interface to capture on, and the file to output to need to be 
 specified on the command line. 

 For example, to capture all traffic arriving on interface eth2:

   $ python py_api_1.py eth2 ./eth2.pcap

 There is an optional argument which can be provided to cause the VI
 and writer to run in separate threads:

   $ python py_api_1.py eth2 ./eth2.pcap 1
