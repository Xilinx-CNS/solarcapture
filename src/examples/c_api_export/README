Introduction
============

 This example illustrates how to export content of packets captured with
 SolarCapture C API for external processing.

 In the scenario there are n threads created and the incoming traffic is split
 so that each of the threads receives subset of the traffic based on
 source and destination IP addresses' hash.

 A sample implementation of SolarCapture custom node is provided that perform
 exporting and splitting of the traffic.


Building the extensions examples library
========================================

 To build the application, run the following command:

   $ make

 Note that by default the example may be installed in a directory
 where only root has write privileges.  You can either run as root or
 you can copy the files to another directory.


Using extensions examples
=========================

 To run the built application, run the following command:

 $ ./c_api_export <intf> <n_consumers>

 Note that you will need root privileges to run the example.
